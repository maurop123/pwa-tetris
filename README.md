# pwa-tetris

An enhanced version of **vue-tetris** which was forked from [http://binaryify.github.io/vue-tetris/](https://github.com/Binaryify/vue-tetris)

## Why?

Jane McGonigal, author of _SuperBetter: A Revolutionary Approach to Getting Stronger, Happier, Braver and More Resilient - Powered by the Science of Games_, shares a study the shows that 30% of the intensity of cravings can be reduced by visual puzzle games like Tetris. Apparently, a large component of cravings has to do with our minds **imagining** ourselves attaining the object of our said craving, and by occupying our visual cortex with some other highly engaging visual stimuli, we are able to buy ourselves some time and space from giving in to our guilty pleasure, at least long enough to empower ourselves with the possibility of conscious choice.

Not that a game like Tetris needs any justification to make, or in this case improve. I just have found that getting to use Tetris in this way has helped me tremendously on my path towards greater mental health, and I wanted to make this game of Tetris (which is made with Vue which I love <3) more accessible by making it playable offline as a Progressive Web App!
